This was my very first project as a programmer. I worked on it by myself during a span of 3 months where I taught myself PHP, SQL, and HTML. The W3.CSS template used for the website can be accessed through the following link: https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/tryit.asp?filename=tryw3css_templates_interio

**What the project entails:** 
1. The final product will be accessible on various platforms such as MacOSX, IOS and Windows.
2. The final product will verify the identity of each user through data inputs such as username and password.
3. The user interface is simple and navigation through the site is easy.
4. Multiple leagues can be created and set up privately.
5. A leaderboard/pointing system will allow clear visualization of who is currently on top.
6. Predictions can be easily set and updated if an error occurs.
7. The user is allowed to change the password of their account.
8. The creator of the league can choose to invite a specific player, making leagues private.
9. The final product will provide encryption for important data (i.e. passwords) to provide safe navigation through the site.
10. The user can view the latest matches which need predicting to be aware of the due date.
